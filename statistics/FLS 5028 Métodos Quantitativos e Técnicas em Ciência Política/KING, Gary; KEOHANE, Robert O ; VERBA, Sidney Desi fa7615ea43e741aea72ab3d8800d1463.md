# Introduction  - Chapter 1

> Nonstatistical research will produce more reliable results if researchers pay attention to the rules of scientific inference - rules that are sometimes more clearly stated in the style of quantitative research p.6
> 

## Scientific research definition - p.8

> Science is a **********************************social enterprise**********************************
> 
1. the goal is inference through description or explanation on the basis of empirical information
2. The procedures are publica and its realiability can be asessed
3. Conclusions are uncertain (Popper’s falsiability principle)
4. The content is the method, which is replicable to any phenomena

> Complexity is partly conditional on the state of our theory p.10
> 

> Scientific generalizations are useful even when studying highly unusual events that do not fall under a class of events […]. [they] can be studied scientifically if we pay attention to improving theory, data, and our use of data […]. Through conceptual clarification and specification of variables, [we] can generate more observable implications and even test causal theories of unique events p. 12

## Major components of research design

> A dynamic process of inquiry occurs within a stable structure of rules p.12

1. **************************************************************RESEARCH QUESTIONS (p.14 to 19)**************************************************************

> A research should pose a question that is importante in the real world […] and makes specific contribution to an identifiable scholarly literature […] by increasing our collective ability to draw inferences p.15

****************How? -**************** some suggestions on pages 16 and 17 - finding evidence to support or falsify unexplored or accepted hypothesis; explore controversies on the field; iluminate new topics

1. **********************THE THEORY (p.19 to 23)**********************

> Choose a theory that is capable of generating as many observable implications as possible” p.19
> 

This equals to more chances of being tested, thus being falsified.

> Theories must be concretly stated, not vaguely p.20
> 

Your data collection process must be theoretically guided. Be careful with ad hoc adjustments to the theory, avoinding them at all costs (p.21)

1. ********************************************THE DATA (p. 23 to 27)********************************************

> Record and report the process step by step by which the data are generated p.23
> 

Do so in a replicable way, reassuring that it is reliable. Collect as many observations as possible, and:

> Maximize the validity of measurements p.25
> 

That is, measruing as close as possible to the concepts.

1. **********************************************************THE USE OF DATA (p. 27 to 28)**********************************************************

When using already existed data, generate averages and estimates of uncertainty of those estimates (p.27. And be efficent, that is:

> An efficient use of data involves maximizing the information used for inference or description p.28
> 

In other words, do ***************more with less.***************
